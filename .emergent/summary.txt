<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a premium, modern, dark-themed e-commerce website for digital goods, similar to ottsathi.com and gameshopnepal.com.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- **Homepage:** Display customer reviews prominently, followed by a grid of products. A Check All Reviews button should link to a Trustpilot page. The background should be pitch black.
- **Product System:** Products should have square images, variations (e.g., different plans/prices), and a rich-text description. The Add to Cart button is replaced with an Order Now button that redirects to a specific WhatsApp number.
- **Admin Panel:** A comprehensive admin panel is required to manage the entire site.
    - **Content Management:** Add/edit products (with variations and image uploads), reviews (with manual date setting), and content for static pages (About Us, Contact, FAQ, Terms and Conditions).
    - **Product Features:** Admins should be able to create categories, arrange the display order of products, and add tags (e.g., 'popular', 'sale').
    - **Other Management:** Edit/add social media links.
- **Authentication:** The admin panel should be secured with a hardcoded username and password (/).
- **UI/UX:** The site must have a premium feel, and the user has requested several UI cleanups, including removing specific text sections, borders, and badges. All pages, especially the admin panel, must be mobile-responsive.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend has been developed. The application features a dark theme, a homepage with reviews, a product grid, and product detail pages. A comprehensive, mobile-responsive admin panel allows for the management of products, categories (with image uploads), reviews, and static pages. Authentication is handled by JWT with hardcoded admin credentials. Previous user requests to fix mobile UI, implement image uploads, add category management, and remove various UI elements have been completed. All initial product and category data has been cleared as requested.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent began implementing a large multi-part feature request from the user. This involved updating the backend to support product ordering (via an  field), product tags, and a full CRUD system for FAQs.
    - Agent was trying to fulfill the user's request to add product ordering, product tags, an editable FAQ system, a Terms and Conditions page, fix social media icons, and remove the Contact page and Admin button.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** both
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Admin panel functionality concern (Priority: P1)**
-   **Issue 2: Social media icons not working (Priority: P0)**

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Admin panel functionality concern**
    - The user stated, Admin panel still not working properly. While the agent addressed the specific follow-up requests (category creation, image upload), this general statement was never fully investigated. It may indicate other undiscovered bugs.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        - Log in as admin (/).
        - Perform a full regression test of the admin panel:
            - Create, read, update, and delete a **Category**.
            - Create, read, update, and delete a **Product** (including image upload and variations).
            - Create, read, update, and delete a **Review**.
            - Update content on the **Pages** management screen.
            - Create, read, update, and delete a **Social Link**.
        - Check the browser's developer console for any errors on all admin pages.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This ensures the core site management functionality is stable and reliable for the user.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?** N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
-   **Issue 2: Social media icons not working**
    - The user reported that the social media icons in the footer are not working.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        - Inspect .
        - Verify how icons are being rendered. The current implementation might be using a complex function that is failing.
        - Simplify the logic to use a direct mapping from the social platform name (e.g., 'facebook') to the correct  icon component.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will restore important navigation links and improve the site's professionalism.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?** N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete multi-part feature implementation (Priority: P0)**

**Task Detail:**
-   **Task 1: Complete multi-part feature implementation**
    - **Where to resume:** The backend  has been updated to support product ordering, tags, and an FAQ model. The frontend  was also updated for FAQ endpoints. The next step is to build out all the required frontend components.
        - **Product Management:** Update  to add UI for setting product  (e.g., via a number input) and for selecting/managing .
        - **FAQ Management:** Create a new page  for creating, editing, deleting, and re-ordering FAQs. Add a link to this page in the admin sidebar ().
        - **Terms & Conditions Page:** Create a static page for Terms and Conditions and add a link in the footer. This can be managed via the existing Pages system in the admin panel.
        - **Removals:**
            - Remove the  page route from  and any links to it in the footer or elsewhere.
            - Remove the Admin button from the public-facing site navigation (e.g., in  or ).
    - **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the user's latest set of feature requests, giving them more control over their products and site content.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Future Task (P2):** The agent previously suggested adding a Recent Purchases ticker to the homepage to increase social proof. This could be re-proposed to the user as a future enhancement.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-Stack Scaffolding**: Initial creation of the FastAPI backend and React frontend.
- **Hardcoded Admin Auth**: Implemented JWT authentication with fixed credentials (/) and removed the public registration flow.
- **Core Admin Panel**: Built a comprehensive admin dashboard to manage products, reviews, static pages, and social links.

- **Mobile UI Overhaul**: Refactored the entire application, especially the admin panel, to be fully responsive and functional on mobile devices.
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed multiple user-requested elements like trust badges on the homepage and product page, borders around product cards, and the Made with Emergent badge.
- **Data Reset**: Cleared all seeded products and categories to provide a clean slate for the user.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : The core of the application logic. Recently updated to add  and  to the  model and to add a new  model with CRUD endpoints.
- : Needs to be updated to support the new  and  functionality.
- : The admin sidebar; needs to be updated with a link to the new FAQ management page.
- : The site footer; needs social media icons fixed and the Contact link removed.
- : The main React router; needs the  route removed and a new admin route for FAQs added.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The immediate priority is to finish the large, multi-part feature request that is currently in progress. The backend models have been updated, but the frontend UI is not yet implemented.
- The admin credentials are  / .
- The database is currently empty of products and categories. The admin must create categories before they can be assigned to products.
- The user has previously expressed general dissatisfaction with the admin panel (not working properly). After implementing the current features, a full regression test of the admin panel is highly recommended to ensure stability.
